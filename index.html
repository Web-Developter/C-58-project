            <p> I like to bike. Biking is good for you and you can become very tall. Whenever I have free time and the weather is good, I usually go out to bike. Now people at my age are pretty tall and I need to get tall as well. I like biking because it is helpful to us, is physical exercise, helps us use time, and mostly because it is fun!</p>
